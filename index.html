    <p>HTML is the language let you indicate by placing a forward slash (/) before the tags closing bracket. The
        tag may also contain attributes indicated with an intervening ellipsis. HTML elements are the building
        blocks of a web page. A tag tells the web browser where an element begins and ends, whereas an attribute
        describes the characteristics of an element.</p>

        <h2>BLOCK LEVEL ELEMENT</h2>
        <p>A block-level element takes up the entire width of a page. It always starts a new line in the document. For
            example, a heading element will be in a separate line from a paragraph element.

            Every HTML page uses these three tags:

            <html> tag is the root element that defines the whole HTML document.

            <head> tag holds meta information such as the page’s title and charset.

            <body> tag encloses all the content that appears on the page.

        <h2>LIST TAGS</h2>
        <p>List tags have different variations. Use the
            ol tag for an ordered list, and use ul for an unordered list. Then, enclose individual list items using the
            li tag. </p>
    </section>
    <section id="inlineelements">
        <h2>INLINE ELEMENTS</h2>
        <P>An inline element formats the inner content of block-level elements, such as adding links and emphasized
            strings. Inline elements are most commonly used to format text without breaking the flow of the content.For
            example, a strong tag would render an element in bold, whereas the em tag would show it in italics.
            Hyperlinks are also inline elements that use an <a> tag and an href attribute to indicate the link’s
                destination:</P>
